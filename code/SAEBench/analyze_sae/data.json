    "2":"Film, also known as movies or motion pictures, is a form of storytelling that combines visual imagery, sound, and performance to entertain, inform, and inspire audiences. The film industry refers to the global network of production, distribution, and exhibition companies that create and market films. It encompasses everything from scriptwriting, directing, acting, cinematography, and editing to marketing and box-office distribution. Major film industries include Hollywood in the United States, Bollywood in India, and the thriving industries in Europe, China, and Japan.",

The country played a central role in the Roman Empire and later the Renaissance, producing legendary figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo Galilei.",
    "6":"Crime can be seen from many angles: legal, psychological, or social. Criminal behavior often reflects societal issues, personal circumstances, or mental health struggles, and the justice system aims to balance punishment with rehabilitation. True crime stories fascinate many because they explore the dark side of human nature",
    "7":"Images capture moments, emotions, and stories that words sometimes cannot. In the digital age, images dominate communication, from social media to advertising. They can inspire, inform, or even manipulate, depending on how they are presented",
    "8":"A camera is a device used to capture photos or videos. From classic analog cameras to modern digital and smartphone cameras, they vary in complexity and capability, but all rely on controlling light to create an image. Cameras are tools for art, documentation, and storytelling.",
    "9":"Video is a recording of moving images, often with sound. It captures time in motion, making it ideal for storytelling, education, entertainment, and communication. With digital technology, video production and sharing have become highly accessible worldwide.",
    "10":"Film originally referred to photographic film, a medium coated with light-sensitive chemicals used to capture images. In cinema, “film” also refers to movies. While digital cameras dominate today, film photography is still appreciated for its aesthetic, texture, and nostalgic qualities",
    "11":"In the past, photos and films were saved on physical materials — photographic paper, negatives, or reels of film. These formats were fragile and required careful storage to avoid fading or damage. With the rise of digital technology, however, the way people save photos and videos has completely changed.",
    "12":"Today, most images and videos are stored in digital form — as files made up of digits (0s and 1s). That’s where the word digital comes from: it refers to data represented by discrete numbers rather than continuous physical media. These digital files can be saved on hard drives, memory cards, cloud servers, or even shared instantly across the internet.This shift from film to digital means photos and videos are easier to store, copy, and edit. But it also raises new challenges — like file corruption, storage limits, and the need for constant backups as technology evolves",

    "16":"A queen is the powerful female ruler or the consort of a king, but the word’s connotation goes far beyond monarchy. It represents grace, intelligence, authority, and often beauty or dignity.",
    "17":"A prince is traditionally the son of a king or queen — a future ruler or member of the royal family. The word often symbolizes promise, potential, and honor.In history and literature, princes are portrayed as brave heroes or noble figures — think of Prince Hamlet in Shakespeare’s tragedy, or the many fairy-tale princes who embark on quests to rescue kingdoms or find true love.",
    "18":"A princess is the daughter of a monarch or the wife of a prince. Traditionally, she represents grace, beauty, and gentleness, but over time, this image has grown more powerful.Classic fairy tales gave us the image of the beautiful princess waiting for rescue, but modern stories — like Princess Diana in real life or Princess Leia in Star Wars — have transformed the idea into one of strength, independence, and leadership",
    "19":"The captain is the leader of the ship. He (or she) holds the responsibility for everything that happens on board — from navigation to safety, from discipline to decision-making. A good captain is not only skilled in steering through storms and waves but also wise in guiding people.The sailor, on the other hand, is the heart and hands of the ship. Sailors work day and night — tightening ropes, cleaning decks, steering the wheel, and keeping watch under the stars.",

    "21":"A novel and a comic are two different but related ways of telling stories. Both share the same purpose: to express human experiences through imagination and creativity.However, the way they tell their stories is quite different. A novel speaks entirely through language. The writer uses words to paint pictures in the reader’s mind, describing places, people, and feelings in detail. Reading a novel requires imagination, because the world exists only through text. A comic, on the other hand, combines pictures and words. It tells its story through images, speech bubbles, and color, allowing readers to see the world directly as the artist imagines it. This makes a comic faster and more visual, while a novel often feels slower and more reflective.",
    "22":"Traditionally, novels were viewed as a serious literary form, while comics were seen as light entertainment for younger readers. Yet today, that distinction has faded. Many comics, especially modern graphic novels, are rich in meaning and artistic value, just like great literature.",
    "23":"A comic, however, is born from art. It uses drawings, colors, and visual expression to tell a story.A novel is created through writing, while a comic is created through drawing or painting. In a novel, the author builds the entire world with words",
    "24":"A bull and a cow are both members of the same species — cattle — but they differ in gender, role, and symbolism. A bull is the male, known for its strength, power, and muscular build. Bulls are often used for breeding, and in many cultures, they symbolize courage, energy, and determination.",

    "26":"On a ship, the captain, navigator, and sailor each have distinct roles that shape their key characteristics. The captain is defined by leadership, decision-making, and responsibility, overseeing the entire ship, setting strategy, and ensuring the safety of everyone on board. The navigator is characterized by precision, analytical skills, and meticulous planning, focusing on charting courses, determining positions, and anticipating changes to guide the ship safely to its destination. The sailor embodies execution, endurance, and teamwork, carrying out practical tasks, maintaining the ship, and forming the backbone of daily operations. Although their roles differ, these three positions complement each other, working together to ensure a smooth, safe, and efficient voyage.",
    "27":"Cars and airplanes are both considered vehicles because they are machines designed to transport people or goods from one place to another, but they differ greatly in their design, function, and usage. A car is a wheeled vehicle that travels on roads, powered by an internal combustion engine, an electric motor, or a hybrid system, and it typically carries a small number of passengers for daily commuting, personal travel, or local transport of goods",
    "28":"a king usually comes from a royal family.In most monarchies, the title of king is inherited, meaning it passes down through generations within the same family. When a king or queen dies or steps down, their child, brother, or another close relative from the royal bloodline becomes the next ruler. This is called royal succession"
