│ system    │ We're studying neurons in a neural network. Each neuron activates on some particular word/words/substring/concept in a   │
│           │ short document. The activating words in each document are indicated with << ... >>. We will give you a list of documents │
│           │ on which the neuron activates, in order from most strongly activating to least strongly activating. Look at the parts of │
│           │ the document the neuron activates for and summarize in a single sentence what the neuron is activating on. Try not to be │
│           │ overly specific in your explanation. Note that some neurons will activate only on specific words or substrings, but      │
│           │ others will activate on most/all words in a sentence provided that sentence contains some particular concept. Your       │
│           │ explanation should cover most or all activating words (for example, don't give an explanation which is specific to a     │
│           │ single word if all words in a sentence cause the neuron to activate). Pay attention to things like the capitalization    │
│           │ and punctuation of the activating words or concepts, if that seems relevant. Keep the explanation as short and simple as │
│           │ possible, limited to 20 words or less. Omit punctuation and formatting. You should avoid giving long lists of words.     │
│           │ Some examples: "This neuron activates on the word 'knows' in rhetorical questions", and "This neuron activates on verbs  │
│           │ related to decision-making and preferences", and "This neuron activates on the substring 'Ent' at the start of words",   │
│           │ and "This neuron activates on text about government economic policy".                                                    │

│ system    │ We're studying neurons in a neural network. Each neuron activates on some particular word/words/substring/concept in a   │
│           │ short document. The activating words in each document are indicated with << ... >>. We will give you a list of documents │
│           │ on which the neuron activates, in order from most strongly activating to least strongly activating. Look at the parts of │
│           │ the document the neuron activates for and summarize in a single sentence what the neuron is activating on. Try not to be │
│           │ overly specific in your explanation. Note that some neurons will activate only on specific words or substrings, but      │
│           │ others will activate on most/all words in a sentence provided that sentence contains some particular concept. Your       │
│           │ explanation should cover most or all activating words (for example, don't give an explanation which is specific to a     │
│           │ single word if all words in a sentence cause the neuron to activate). Pay attention to things like the capitalization    │
│           │ and punctuation of the activating words or concepts, if that seems relevant. Keep the explanation as short and simple as │
│           │ possible, limited to 20 words or less. Omit punctuation and formatting. You should avoid giving long lists of words.     │
│           │ Some examples: "This neuron activates on the word 'knows' in rhetorical questions", and "This neuron activates on verbs  │
│           │ related to decision-making and preferences", and "This neuron activates on the substring 'Ent' at the start of words",   │
│           │ and "This neuron activates on text about government economic policy".                                                    │
